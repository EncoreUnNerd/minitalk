# üí¨ minitalk

Welcome to the repo of my ‚Äúminitalk‚Äù project from 42 school.

## Description of this project

The aim of the project is to create 2 executables, 1 server and 1 client. The client sends a string of characters to the server, and the server displays them. Obviously, each character must be sent bit by bit to the server, and the server must send a signal to the client to tell it that it has received the bit each time, otherwise it's no fun. 

The project is great fun, even if there are some recurring problems due to the bone, such as timing problems etc... This version of minitalk is perfect for buntu 22.04, but testing on macos once every 5 messages a signal is lost causing problems but I really don't know where the problem comes from, so if you have the solution don't hesitate to make a request or something like that.

DON'T CLONE THIS PROJECT. As always, I recommend that you do it yourself, otherwise there's no point. This repo is there to keep track of the past. But if you ever want another perspective on the project, it can also be useful.
